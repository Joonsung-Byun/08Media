            <h2>What is Soccer?</h2>
                <p>Soccer is a team sport played by a team of 11 players against another team of 11 players on a field.
                    The team has one designated goalkeeper and 10 outfield players. Outfield players are usually specialised in attacking or defending or both.
                    A team is typically split into defenders, midfielders and forwards, though there is no restriction on players moving anywhere on the pitch.
                    There are many soccer players who are considered a <a href="players.html#greatPlayers">great players</a>.
                    It is known as soccer in North America, but is called football in most of the rest of the world. Its full name is Association Football.

                    Plus, there is a union of world soccer called FIFA. FIFA is an international organization responsible for football, futsal, and beach

            <h2>History of Soccer</h2>
                <p>Soccer, or better known to the rest of the world as football, is one of the oldest sports in history. 
                    Dating back to 206 B.C., there are accounts of Chinese soldiers playing Tsu'chu, “kicking the ball,”
                    to supplement their training regiments during the Han Dynasty. While many other ancient cultures played 
                    games involving a ball, Tsu'chu was the first to not allow hands. Goals consisted of a net attached to 
                    two bamboo poles and elevated 30 feet in the air. This is quite the contrast to modern goals that sit on 
                    the ground and extend eight feet high and 24 feet wide. The particular style of playing a game with a ball,
                    centered around one's feet, spread throughout the world. 
                    During the medieval period in Europe, particularly in England, games were played in towns that pitted rival 
                    squads against one another. This was called Folkball. The goal was to place the ball into a designated area,
                    usually the captain's house, to score a point. This would often entail a distance of a few miles between 
                    scoring destinations. Games typically resulted in low scoring matches as the process of advancing the ball 
                    would be brutal and without regard to one's well being. Without any set rules the game would cause massive 
                    commotion throughout the towns in which it was held, leading to its ban in the 14th century. 
                    In 1863, official rules for football were drawn up to create an organized game in England. These rules 
                    formally differentiated between rugby football and association football. Hence, modern football was born.
